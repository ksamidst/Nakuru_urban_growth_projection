_____________INTRODUCTION_____________<br/>

This work is part of project MIDST; (Monitoring for Information and Decisions using Space Technologies) piloted by the Kenya Space Agency (KSA),
in collaboration with a team from other government institutions. It is part of a subproject Spatial Planning and Urbanization. This code allows users to
run an urban growth prediction algorithm applying the cellular automata technique. Using the datasets provided in this repository as guided in the script
file 'code.py', you will be able to generate a prediction map for Nakuru for the year 2030.

______________RUNNING THE SCRIPT______________<br/>

This process will consist of four steps as follows:<br/>
1.) Downloading the files<br/>
3.) Loading the data onto QGIS platform
4.) Modifications to the script<br/>
5.) Visualizing the product<br/>

_______________1.) DOWNLOADING THE FILES____________________<br/>
<br/>
Click on the 'Clone' button at the top of this page, then click on 'Download ZIP', as shown in the image above. Once the zipped file is downloaded, 
extract the files to a location of your choice. You can open the folders to view the files. There are a number of different files in the folder; 
there is the script file containing the GEE code and the sub-folders containing the assets (shape files).
